About

What does Zen mean to you? We asked our teachers and staff, and got answers like:

Focus.
Balance.
Never-ending-awareness.
Peace.
Clarity.
Zen.

There are many ways to interpret our work, but we strive to provide a flexible, holistic framework for you to discover your own meaning. After your time with us, youâ€™ll have a whole new idea about Zen!
